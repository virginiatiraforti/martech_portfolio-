# Martech Portfolio

This repository includes a curated selection of practical projects and prototypes developed across different contexts â€” combining business logic, automation workflows, and data-driven strategy in the Martech field.

ðŸ”¹ **AUTHEMA** â€“ My personal initiative focused on marketing automation, CRM implementation, and data orchestration for SMEs.  
ðŸ”¹ **Epicode Projects** â€“ A series of exercises and assignments completed during an intensive Martech training program, covering CRM setup, automation flows, analytics, and chatbot design.

The goal is to showcase a cross-functional approach to Martech: strategic, adaptable, and hands-on.  
Work in progress â€“ more use cases and assets will be added progressively.
